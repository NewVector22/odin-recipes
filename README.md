# odin-recipes

This site is a project completed as a part of The Odin Project's curriculum on html and css web development. The site contains recipes for some favorite Christmas cookies.

Skills Demonstrated in This Project:
-Using git workflows to manage versions within a repository.
-Commit message conventions and best practices.
-Creating, modifying, and saving .html files using terminal and VS Code.
-Basic file structure conventions for pages and images.

After completing this project and reflecting on the process, I will continue to review and practice the html boilerplate structure. I will also make an effort to do more of my work in VS Code in order to get used to the default workflow and shortcuts in the program. I am starting to become comfortable with the basics of coding in html.
