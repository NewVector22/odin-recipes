            <h3>Description</h3>
            <body>
                <p>This is an old family recipe that has become a favorite in my household. A holiday-spiced 
                    cookie dough is stuffed with a cherry and walnut filling and folded 
                    to resemble a "bell" shape. Half a marschino cherry serves as bell's clapper.</p>
                <p>Spice bells have become one of my favorite Christmas cookie recipes and they are sure 
                    to find a place of prominence on your own holiday cookie tray!

                    <li>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. Using a round 2 inch cookie cutter, cut dough

                    <li>Spoon 1 tablespoon of filling on the lower half of each circle. Fold the sides in at the top 1/3 of the 
                        cookie to form a bell shape. Place half a cherry in the filling to form the bell clapper.</li>
