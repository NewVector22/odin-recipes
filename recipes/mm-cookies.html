        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer or using a bowl and hand mixer, cream together the shortening, 
                sugar, and brown sugar until fluffy and light in color (about 2 minutes). Using a silicone spatula, scrape 
                down the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix in egg and vanilla until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, wisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>With the mixer running on low, gradually add the dry ingredients until just combined. Scrape down the 
                sides and bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>With a wooden spatula or spoon, stir in M&M candies until well distributed. Do not over-mix.</li>
            <li>Drop 2 Tablespoon portions of dough on the lined baking sheet approximately 1 inch apart. Bake for 10-12 
                minutes or until cookies are set around the outside and light brown in color.
